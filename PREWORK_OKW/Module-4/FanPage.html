    <H2>Biography</H2>

        <p>
        Breaking Benjamin is an American rock band from Wilkes-Barre, Pennsylvania, formed in 1999 by lead singer and guitarist Benjamin Burnley and drummer Jeremy Hummel. The first lineup of the band also included guitarist Aaron Fink and bassist Mark Klepaski. Hummel would be replaced by Chad Szeliga in 2005. The band released four albums before entering an extended hiatus due to the lead singer's ongoing health issues. During the hiatus, legal issues arose that led to the dismissal of two members and the departure of a third, leaving Benjamin Burnley as the only remaining member in late 2014. He would go on to rebuild the band with bassist and backing vocalist Aaron Bruch, guitarist and backing vocalist Keith Wallen, guitarist Jasen Rauch, and drummer Shaun Foist. This lineup has released two original albums thus far.
