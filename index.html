      <h1>Introduction</h1>
      <p>I'm a former Marine as well as a former Airman, and I'm currently in the final year of my apprenticeship for the International Brotherhood of Electrical Workers (IBEW). I tend to be antisocial--not socially inept. (I don't like people, but I've developed enough skills to deal with them. For some strange reason people still like me...or at least they pretend to.)</p>
      <h1>Where I'm From</h1>
      <p>East Dublin, GA</p>
      <h1>What are your favorite hobbies?</h1>
      <p>I'm an avid gamer who's particularly fond of role-playing games--especially of the massively multiplayer online variety (MMORPGs or MMOs as we generally call them)--and various fighting games.</p>
      <h1>What's your dream job?</h1>
      <p>I don't have one. (Seriously, anyone who dreams of working needs to have their head examined.)</p>
      <h1>Where do you live?</h1>
      <p>I currently live in Peachtree Corners, GA--very close to the Training Center for the IBEW.</p>
      <h1>Why do you want to be a web developer?</h1>
      <p>I don't, actually. I'm just buffing my curriculum vitae.</p>
